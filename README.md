# Scalable Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple browser-based tic-tac-toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to specify the board size and take turns marking cells on a grid to try to get all their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and win the game.

## Features

- Dynamic board size: Players can choose the size of the board (minimum 3x3).
- Player turns: Players take turns marking cells with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O').
- Win detection: The game detects when a player has won by getting all their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
